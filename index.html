            <P>Hi Andrei here!, 16 years old. Currently a programming student in CIIT SHS.
                What you need to know about me is that I am very family oriented and I'm also sporty, I love playing sports
                its my escape whenever im stressed or just bored. I want to be either an Electrical engineering or a seafarer, becuase im very interested on how
                things work and if its possible be a seafarer at the same time since i want to explore the whole world by sea!
            </P>
